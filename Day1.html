        <p><!-- "p" stands for paragraph. That meas we put here block of text we want to include in given paragraph. -->
            First of all what do I know and what am I gonna learn. Let's add image from friend and analyze it.<br>
            <img class="resize50" src="figures/front_dev_diag.png" alt="Front-end Diagram" ><br> <!-- <img> allows to input image from local or external host -->
            Now I can set my learning process to learn from basics concepts of web developing up to more difficult and complex ideas.<br><br>  
        </p>
    
        <h3 id="idea">Learning idea</h3>
        <p>
            For as little as I know starting from complete basics will be best. First I setted up Visual Studio Code for easier coding with real live preview and created repository on GitHub.
            That lead me to:
            <a href="https://github.com/helloroman/od-czego-zaczac-nauke" target="_blank"><em>"Od czego zacząć?"</em></a> <!-- <a> is a hyperlink holding tag and <em> allows for italic when <strong> bolds words -->
            , which is really interesting file providing various websites to help newbies like me. At this point i decided on creating learning schedule not to get lost in case of giving up as I mostly do.
        </p>
    
        <h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
        <p>
            Due to lack of any job right now i plan on working few hours a day to see how much I can improve.<br>
            My learning order will be then:
            <ol> <!-- Creating ordered, that means numbered, list with <li> listed items -->
                <li>Basics</li>
                <ul> <!-- <ul> stands for unordered list that is dotted points -->
                    <li>HTML5</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
                <li>CSS framework - Bootstrap</li>
                <li>CSS preprocessor - Sass</li>
                <li>Responsive Web?</li>
                <li>JavaScript Task Runners</li>
                <li>What is ES6?</li>
                <li>Package Manager</li>
                <li>TypeScript</li>
                <li>Module Loader/Bundler</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            Probably order will be change during realization because I don't know half of the words. But let's start from basics now.

        <h3>HTML5 vs Old School HTML</h3>
        <p>
            So basically what is the difference between things I learned in primary school and ones I am going to learn now? 
            Generally in 2014 HTML was updated to version 5 facilitating work for web developers. 
            So many inprovements were introduced that it would take whole page to write about them.<br>
            But this document is for me to learn how to code and not to write a lot so <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/html-vs-html5" target="_blank">here</a> is a link to learn more about HTML improvement over years.
        </p>

        <h3>Browser tutorial</h3>
        <p>
            I started with Codecademy basic tutorial for HTML. Iam not going to write much about content I found there but highly recommend to check it out <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">here</a>.
            <br>
            What i learned:
            <ul>
                <li>What is HTML</li>

                <li>Headings and sub-headings</li>
                <li><code>&ltp&gt, &ltspan&gt</code> and <code>&ltdiv&gt</code> tags</li> <!-- <code> allows us to write <> signs and have all other text in same line while <pre> put us in line below -->
                <li><code>&ltbr&gt</code> line break</li>
                <li>ordered <code>&ltol&gt</code> and unordered <code>&ltul&gt</code> list</li>
